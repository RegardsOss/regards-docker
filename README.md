# REGARDS deployment

This repository contains the playbook used to deploy REGARDS stack thanks to Ansible on Linux servers.  
All REGARDS docker images are publicly available [on our Github package repository](https://github.com/orgs/RegardsOss/packages).

We're also working on REGARDS Kubernates deployment.

You can find the updated version of the tutorial on our documentation:
